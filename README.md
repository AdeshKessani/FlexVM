# GritVM with IntDList

A C++ project featuring a custom virtual machine implementation (GritVM) alongside an efficient doubly linked list (IntDList). Designed for educational purposes and software development involving VM execution and data structure manipulation.

## Features
- Virtual Machine core with extensible base classes
- Custom doubly linked list for flexible data management
- Comprehensive test coverage with Catch2
- Cross-platform build and debug configurations included

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler with C++11 support or above
- Catch2 testing framework (included)

### Build Instructions
Use your preferred build system (e.g., CMake or Visual Studio) to compile the source files.

### Running Tests
Compile and run the `PP2Test.cpp` and other test files to verify correctness.

## Project Structure
- `GritVM.hpp`, `GritVM.cpp`: Virtual machine implementation
- `IntDList.hpp`, `IntDList.cpp`: Doubly linked list data structure
- `catch.hpp`: Catch2 testing framework
- `PP2Test.cpp`: Additional tests
- Configuration files (`settings.json`, `launch.json`, etc.)
